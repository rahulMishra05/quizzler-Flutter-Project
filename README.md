# Quizzler

In this project we had made a quiz application. This app contains 13 questions and in oreder to answer each question user have to choose between "True" and "False".

If the answer is correct then a check sign in green colour will appear at the bottom of the screen and if the answer is wrong then a cross sign will appear at the bottom of the screen in red colour.

When all the 13 questions are completed then an alert will appear having a message "Finished!  You've reached the end of the quiz" followed by a button, which have a functionality that when we click on that button then the quiz will start from starting.

For having this alert functionality we have to import an package from the official website for Dart packages https://pub.dev/. And from there we had impotred an package name as "rflutter_alert" https://pub.dev/packages/rflutter_alert#-readme-tab-, after installing this package to uor flutter project we had used the "Basic Alert" functionality to show an alert to the user
